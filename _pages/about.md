I'm Phuc Nguyen.
Most people will pronounce my name wrong (tell me about that).

Here is how to pronounce my name: [/fukb/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV_n4aDs6qo) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TodCZhhbVKo)

I grew up in Vietnam but currently in the US for my Master degree in System Design at [SJSU](https://www.sjsu.edu/ee/).

My Thesis/Project advisor: [Choo, Chang Y](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/chang.choo/)

Current Project is based on [Prof.Bill Dally's presentation](https://hc2023.hotchips.org/assets/program/conference/day2/Keynote%202/Keynote-NVIDIA_Hardware-for-Deep-Learning.pdf):[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsxCZAE8QNA) at [Hot Chips 2023](https://hc2023.hotchips.org/): (2021) [LNS-Madam: Low-Precision Training in Logarithmic Number System using Multiplicative Weight Update](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/low-precision-training-in-logarithmic-number)


Self-taught: [ROS2](https://www.ros.org/), AI ([Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/))

  

- Something to remind myself of:

1. *"A great man is hard on himself; a small man is hard on others."* - Confucius

2. *"Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude."* - Zig Ziglar

3. *"Talent is God-given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful."* - John Wooden

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
